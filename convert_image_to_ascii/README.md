            Default: False
```

## Why?
In trying to find converts, I was surprised to see that there were not that many and of those, little options and choices.  In particular, the characters I wanted to use.  See hangman art that I crated manually instead.

## Improvements?
So much could be done.  Colour? Thought about it.  Better shape/character selection. As in, double the scale of the image and break the characters in to quadrants and measure each.  So images that have a darker upperleft and lower right would be assigned a \ and upper left and lower left would be [, etc

## State?
No known bugs.  Works.
